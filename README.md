# Simulated-Annealing

A Graph Partitioning Algorithm in which the goal is to bi-partition the graph into equal halves with minimum cut size. This reduces the wire length between the nodes that communicates less frequently by partitioning them to the other side. Developed in C. The algorithm is applied to the cluster of nodes in a chip.

The project belongs to the graduate couse "Design Automation" in Electrical Engineering. I am a Computer Science student and I developed the project for my friend from EE department who didn't have any experience in C programming.
